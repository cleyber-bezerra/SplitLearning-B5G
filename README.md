## Abstract

Split Learning (SL) is an innovative and effective approach to address security and privacy concerns in the training of deep neural networks (DNN). This technique combines the protection of raw data with the division of the model between client devices and a central server, significantly reducing the risks of data leaks and cyberattacks. In addition, it enables the training of deep neural networks on devices with limited computational resources.

However, splitting the model leads to an increase in the communication flow between the distributed devices and the central server, which can not only generate a communication overhead in environments with computational constraints, but also negatively impact the training accuracy, compromising the final results of the model.

This paper covers the inference problem of improving accuracy. Through a case study of integrating (ns3-ai) with distributed Split Learning to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and MNIST dataset. The NS3-LENA simulator used the characteristics of a B5G network environment with mobile devices (UE) and a gNB (5G access module).

In this integrated scenario, network experiments were simulated with distance variations between 150 mt. With powers of 10, 30 and 50 dBm and loss exponents of 2, 3 and 4 dB. Based on the network output results, with regard to latency, a policy was defined that values above 4 seconds are considered timeouts and are not included in machine learning experiments. With the objective of training and testing the split learning model, the impacts of changes in the network simulation on training accuracy were observed.

## Baselines

The methods defined as baselines for our proposal are: (1) the use of the synchronous algorithm in the training of the Split Learning Vanilla model and (2) the definition of the training based on events provided by the simulation in NS3, following the latency policy established in 15 distinct seeds for each exponent. In the simulation, six (06) mobile devices and the base station are considered, with the policy defined for network latency stipulating nodes with latency below 04 seconds.
